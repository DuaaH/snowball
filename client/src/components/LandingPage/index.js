      <h3>The Vision</h3>
      <p>
        A global network of people, fighting climate change together, through
        our everyday actions.
      </p>
      <h3>How do we get there?</h3>
      <p>
        By showing people what they can do, giving them the tools to do it and
        allowing them to commit to a better future. When we act together, small
        changes have a big impact.
      </p>
      <h3>What’s the goal?</h3>
      <p>
        If we bring people together, the power lies with the people in the fight
        against climate change. We want to create a movement to release that
        inner power!
